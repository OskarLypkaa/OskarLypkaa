ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Iâ€™m a Software Engineer in Test (SET) with strong experience in building automated test frameworks, writing clean code, and developing internal tools in Python, PowerShell, JavaScript, and other technologies. My focus areas include:

E2E and UI automation (TestComplete, Selenium-based tools, UIAutomator)

Framework design with clean architecture and maintainable code

CI/CD and test environment management (Azure, GitHub Actions)

Test case design and automation based on technical documentation

Tooling to support QA workflows and engineering teams

ðŸ”’ Repositories
All my repositories are private for two main reasons:

Legacy or outdated code â€” Older projects no longer reflect my current coding standards, clean code practices, or testing methodologies.

Commercial and revenue-generating projects â€” Some repositories contain proprietary or monetized codebases that I actively use or maintain.

If youâ€™d like to see examples of my current work, Iâ€™m open to sharing selected code snippets or demo projects upon request.

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m a **Software Engineer in Test (SET)** with strong experience in building automated test frameworks, writing clean code, and developing internal tools in **Python**, **PowerShell**, **JavaScript**. Recently I've been styding web and desktoptechonogies. 

My focus areas include:

- **E2E and UI automation** (TestComplete, Selenium-based tools)
- **CRM platforms design** with clean architecture and maintainable code
- **Test case design** and automation based on technical documentation
- **Tooling** to support QA workflows and engineering teams

## ðŸ”’ Repositories

_All my repositories are private for two main reasons:_

1. **Legacy or outdated code** â€” Older projects no longer reflect my current coding standards, clean code practices, or testing methodologies.
2. **Commercial and revenue-generating projects** â€” Some repositories contain proprietary or monetized codebases that I actively use or maintain.
